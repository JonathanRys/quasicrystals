# quasicrystals
React app to display a set of points as lines

To run the app:
```
npm run start
```
The script to create the JSON from the csv file found [here](https://github.com/CHandmer/QuasiCrystals/blob/master/HandmerQuasiCrystalVertex.csv) is located in the `/scripts/` folder.

The resulting JSON data was moved to `/src/data`
